# Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python Project

### Exploring K-Means and Heirarchical Clustering for Effective Marketing Strategies

#### Introduction
This project is based on hypothetical customer data to perform market segmentationâ€”crucial for businesses to understand customer and improve marketing efficiency.
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementation of clustering algorithms, and interpretation of results.
I'll use two popular clustering techniques: k-means and hierarchical clustering.

#### Project Requirements
The project requires Python v.3 and Jupyter Notebook. It uses the following Python libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy
* sklearn					

#### Segmentation data - Legend
The dataset of the customer information can be found in `customer_segmentation_data.csv` and its legend in `Segmentation data legend.xlsx` files.
