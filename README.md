# Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python Project

### Exploring K-Means and Heirarchical Clustering for Effective Marketing Strategies

#### Introduction

A customer segmentation model is a strategic tool used in marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) to divide a customer base into groups of individuals who share similar characteristics or behaviors. The goal of customer segmentation is to better understand customers' needs, preferences, and behaviors, and to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to specific customer segments.

This project is based on hypothetical customer data to perform market segmentationâ€”crucial for businesses to understand customer and improve marketing efficiency.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementation of clustering algorithms, and interpretation of results.

I'll use two popular clustering techniques: k-means and hierarchical clustering. These models can pick up on similarities between user groups that often go unnoticed by the human eye.

#### Project Requirements
The project requires Python v.3 and Jupyter Notebook. It uses the following Python libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy
* sklearn					

#### Segmentation data - Legend
The dataset of the customer information can be found in `customer_segmentation_data.csv` and its legend in `Segmentation data legend.xlsx` files.
